# Technician-Scheduling-and-Delivery-Optimization-using-Genetic-Algorithm
This case study involves scheduling the delivery and installation of machines across multiple locations using a fleet of trucks and a team of technicians. The goal is to minimize the overall cost, which includes the truck travel cost, technician travel cost, and penalties for idle machines.
The problem is complex due to various constraints, such as limited truck capacity, technician skills, maximum working days, and delivery time windows.
